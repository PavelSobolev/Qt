## OpenGL demo project for learning of quadric objects

This desktop application uses OpenGL and Qt to provide interactive graphical 3D scene.The scene contains one of possible representation of so called quadric object. This can be flat or 3D figure (circle, disk, sector of circle or disk, sphere, cone, or cylinder). The scene can be controlled with mouse (rotations and movements of the scene are available). Each object can be configured by entering its characteristics in the window's  appropriate widgets. Also, the app shows C++ source code which can create currently drawn scene's object.
