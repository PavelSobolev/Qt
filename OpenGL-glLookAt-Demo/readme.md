## This app show how glLookAt function can affect the graphic scene of OpenGL


A wired model of cylinder is drawn in the main window. A sine wave is drawn on the surface of the cylinder. Along the trajectory of the sine wave two spheres are moving towards each other. One of the spheres is rotating during its motion (around the vector(1,1,0)). The camera is placed on the sinusoid line and can be moved along this curve. The keyboard and mouse can be used to send control commands to change behavior of the scene and its objects.

#### Used technologies

1. C++
2. Qt library / Qt Creator IDE
3. OpenGL / glu.h and glaux.h libraries
